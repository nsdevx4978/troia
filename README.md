# Flickr Demo App for Yorkshire Building Society

The app displays a list of photos with the poster's userid, user icon and a list of tags associated with the photo. Tapping on the photo takes the user to a detail page where they can see Title, date take, any content description  about the photo. Tapping on a user id/photo produces a list of photos by the user.

I used SwiftUI / Combine with MVVM in this demo app. I am not an expert in neither of them but I decided to use this structure as I believe SwiftUI/Combine is the future of Swift development.
